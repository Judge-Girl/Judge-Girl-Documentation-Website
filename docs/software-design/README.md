# Software Design & Microservices

We will talk about the whole software design & design process in this section.

There are many design aspects, I recommend you to read in the sequence of the following list:
 1. [DDD](software-design/ddd/)
 2. Microservices
 3. Clean Architecture
 4. Database Schema Design
 5. Judger Design
 6. DevOps Design
 7. Deployment Design (Docker / K8S)

##  Motivation

To be honest, this project has an humble objective: **to see how Domain Driven Design (DDD), 
Clean Architecture (a methodology written in Uncle Bob's book) and Microservices apply in the complex real world demands.**

Thus this project will be an open source and any discussion or contributions are welcome.
