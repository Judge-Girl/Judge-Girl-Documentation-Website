# Software Design & Microservices

We will talk about the whole software design & design process in this section.

There are many design aspects, I recommend you to read in the sequence of the following list:
 1. [DDD](software-design/ddd/)
 2. [Microservices](software-design/microservices/)
 3. [Clean Architecture](software-design/clean-architecture/)
 4. [Database Schema Design](software-design/database-schema/)
 5. [Judger Design](software-design/judger-design/)
 6. [DevOps Design](software-design/devops-design/)
 7. [Deployment Design (Docker / K8S)](software-design/deployment-design/)

##  Motivation

To be honest, this project has an humble objective: **to see how Domain Driven Design (DDD), 
Clean Architecture (a methodology written in Uncle Bob's book) and Microservices apply in the complex real world demands.**

Thus this project will be an open source and any discussion or contributions are welcome.
