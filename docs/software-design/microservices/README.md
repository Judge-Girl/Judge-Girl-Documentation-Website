# Microservices

From DDD, we've had an overview of our domain language and structure.

**The next step is to directly map every aggregate or entity to a service.** <br> 


## System Architecture

This design procedure of the system architecture, though, depends on the operation capability of your development team. <br>
 As a one-man team, I consider not to have too many services, 
and finally, there are totally four services:
1. **Student Service**
2. **Problem Service**
2. **Submission Service**

> I call them 3-Big-Guys

And the fourth one: **Exam Service**
